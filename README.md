# AppForSavingStuff

Hi, this is Tarnas! :)

This is a constant work in progress - the interface will probably change daily.

This was created because I want to make as much mistakes as I can, so I am writing
very small projects. This is something I wanted to build for quite some time and I 
decided to take this opportunity and play with RavenDB (check it out here: http://ravendb.net/)
Thought it would be a perfect project to learn the basics of this document based database!
